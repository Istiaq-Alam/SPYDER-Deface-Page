## Overview
This project contains an HTML file for a "deface page," often used in ethical hacking demonstrations or cybersecurity training to simulate website security breaches. The page mimics the appearance of a defaced website and serves as a tool for awareness and education about web application security.

## Features

- **Animated Terminal Interface:**
  - Simulates a terminal environment with animated typing effects and dynamic content.
  - Displays warning messages in a styled terminal UI.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.
  - Adjustments made for smaller screens using CSS media queries.

- **Glitch Heading Effect:**
  - A dynamic "glitch" animation applied to the heading for a striking visual effect.

- **Random Background Images:**
  - Displays randomly selected images as the background, enhancing the aesthetics of the page.

- **Sound Effects:**
  - Automatically plays sound effects 1 second after the page loads to create an immersive experience.

## Purpose
This page is intended for **educational purposes only** and aims to:

1. Highlight the importance of securing web applications.
2. Demonstrate the consequences of inadequate web security.
3. Educate developers and administrators about common vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styling and animations.
  - Keyframes for glitch and typing effects.
  - Responsive design using media queries.
- **JavaScript:**
  - Dynamic content updates in the terminal.

  - Sound playback automation.
- **Audio Effects:** Integrated sound files to enhance user experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/deface-page.git

2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the deface page.

3. Optionally, modify the following to customize the page:
   - Terminal messages: Update the `content` array in the `<script>` tag.
   - Background images: Add or change URLs in the `backgrounds` array in the `<script>` tag.
   - Sound effects: Replace the `sound-effect.mp3` file with your preferred sound.
