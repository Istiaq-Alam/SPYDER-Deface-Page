## Overview
This project contains an HTML file for a "deface page," often used in ethical hacking demonstrations or cybersecurity training to simulate website security breaches. The page mimics the appearance of a defaced website and serves as a tool for awareness and education about web application security.

## Features

- **Animated Terminal Interface:**
  - Simulates a terminal environment with animated typing effects and dynamic content.
  - Displays warning messages in a styled terminal UI.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.
  - Adjustments made for smaller screens using CSS media queries.

- **Glitch Heading Effect:**
  - A dynamic "glitch" animation applied to the heading for a striking visual effect.

- **Random Background Images:**
  - Displays randomly selected images as the background, enhancing the aesthetics of the page.

## WebPage Criteria :
- Blinking Loading Window
- Hacking Terminal Toast
- Terminal Closing Loop
- Phrases Typing Animation  
- Instant Inspect Prevention
- Select Element Prevention
- Copy Element Prevention
- Marquee Usernames
- Random Background
- Glitched Defacing Text
- Scramble Text in Terminal Footer 
- Automatic Phrase Changing 
- No Image [Text Only] Page
- Advanced Scripting in 3 Layers
- No-Script Detection with Different Access


## Purpose
This page is intended for **educational purposes only** and aims to:

1. Highlight the importance of securing web applications.
2. Demonstrate the consequences of inadequate web security.
3. Educate developers and administrators about common vulnerabilities.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.

  - Keyframes for glitch and typing effects.
  - Responsive design using media queries.
- **JavaScript:**
  - Dynamic content updates in the terminal.
  - Random background selection.
  - Sound playback automation.
  - No-Script Detection
- **Audio Effects:** Integrated sound files to enhance user experience.  (Under Development | Not Implemented)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Istiaq-Alam/SPYDER-Deface-Page.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the deface page.

3. Optionally, modify the following to customize the page:
   - Terminal messages: Update the `content` array in the `<script>` tag.
   - Background images: Add or change URLs in the `backgrounds` array in the `<script>` tag.
   - ASCII Art: Change the ASCII Art as your prefer into the `<p>` tag on the termal.
   - Scramble Text: Add or change Random phrases in the `<script>` tag (bottom of the terminal) 
   - Sound effects: Replace the `sound-effect.mp3` file with your preferred sound. [Still under development, might not work on all browser] 

## Security Considerations
